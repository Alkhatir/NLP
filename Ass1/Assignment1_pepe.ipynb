Any standard Python library can be used, so far that the library is free and can be simply installed using `pip` or `conda`. Examples of potentially useful libraries are `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `gensim`, `nltk`, `spaCy`, and `AllenNLP`. Use the latest stable version of each library.\n",

The platform enables the classification of text excerpts, extracted from news and reports into a set of domain specific classes. The provided dataset contains the classes (labels) referring to the humanitarian sectors like agriculture, health, and protection. The dataset contains an overall number of 17,301 data points. \n",

When removing tokens from the dictionary, consider a strategy for handling Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) tokens, namely the ones in the train/validation/test datasets that that are not anymore in the dictionary. Some possible strategies could be to remove OOVs completely from the texts, or to replace them with a special token like <OOV\\>.

One applied weighting must be `tf-idf` and the other one can be any other method discussed in the lecture such as `tc`, `tf`, `BM25`. These term weighting methods should be implemented; using a library to readily calculate the term weightings is not allowed. Report the applied approaches.
